* File:RemovePitchFilter.java
* Course: 17655
* Project: Assignment 1
* Copyright: Copyright (c) 2003 Carnegie Mellon University
* Versions:
*	1.0 November 2008 - Initial rewrite of original assignment 1 (ajl).
*
* Description:
*
* This class serves as a template for creating filters. The details of threading, filter connections, input, and output
* are contained in the FilterFramework super class. In order to use this template the program should rename the class.
* The template includes the run() method which is executed when the filter is started.
* The run() method is the guts of the filter and is where the programmer should put their filter specific code.
* In the template there is a main read-write loop for reading from the input port of the filter and writing to the
* output port of the filter. This template assumes that the filter is a "normal" that it both reads and writes data.
* That is both the input and output ports are used - its input port is connected to a pipe from an up-stream filter and
* its output port is connected to a pipe to a down-stream filter. In cases where the filter is a source or sink, you
* should use the SourceFilterTemplate.java or SinkFilterTemplate.java as a starting point for creating source or sink
* filters.
*
* Parameters: 		None
*
* Internal Methods:
*
*	public void run() - this method must be overridden by this class.
